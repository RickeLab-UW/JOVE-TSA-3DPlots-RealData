# Repository Overview

This repository contains simulated microbial enumeration datasets, associated metadata, and R scripts used to generate interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualizations of poultry house litter microbial ecology.

The workflow integrates:

Simulated microbial count data across a structured grid

Log₁₀ transformations for visualization

Spatial modeling relative to environmental features (water line, feeders, pen entrance)

Interactive 3D surface plotting using R (plotly, dplyr)

This project demonstrates a reproducible framework for visualizing spatial microbial gradients within poultry house environments and provides a foundation for applying the same methodology to empirical poultry litter datasets.
